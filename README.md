## 🌐 Introduction

CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges are computer security competitions that test various cybersecurity skills. 

[PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org) is a renowned platform offering a range of these challenges. Within PicoCTF, there's [PicoGym](https://play.picoctf.org/practice?page=1), a dedicated practice area where you can work on various challenges at your own pace. This project is a collection of my solutions to the PicoGym challenges.

Each challenge in this project is tackled as a standalone CTF problem, focusing on various aspects of cybersecurity such as cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, and more.

## 🏁 Solved Challenges

Each challenge is listed in its own directory. The directory name is the title of the challenge. Inside each directory, you'll find:

- A `README.md` file: This is the write-up for the solution, which explains the steps I took to solve the challenge in detail.
- An `exploit` file (if applicable): This file contains the actual exploit code or script that I used to solve the challenge.
- Other potential files: Depending on the challenge, there might be other files such as screenshots, additional scripts, or resources that were used or referenced in the process of solving the challenge.

Here are the challenges I have solved so far, grouped by event:
